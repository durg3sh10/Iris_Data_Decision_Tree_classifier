# Problem Statement:
The task is to create a Decision Tree classifier and visualize it graphically.

The purpose is if we feed any new data to this classifier, it would be able to
predict the right class accordingly.

What is a Decision Tree?
Decision tree is a type of supervised learning algorithm that is mostly used in classification problems. It works for both categorical and continuous input and output variables.

Decision Trees are popular because they have two key properties:

Simplicity: Decision Trees are simple, visually appealing and are easy to interpret.
Accuracy: Advance Decision Tree models show exceptional performance in predicting patterns in complex data.
